         <ul className="list-inside list-disc space-y-2 text-gray-700 text-justify font-[10px]">
           <li >Fees. Unless otherwise agreed upon by EscortsAffair in writing, the fees payable in 
            connection with any Paid Services (“Fees”) will be specified via the EscortsAffair Service.
             All Fees are denominated in U.S. dollars and are exclusive of any applicable taxes.</li>
           <li>Payment Method. You may only pay Fees using valid payment methods acceptable to us, 
            as specified via the EscortsAffair Service. You represent and warrant that you are authorized 
            to use the payment method you designate via the EscortsAffair Service. You authorize us to 
            charge your designated payment method for the total amount of your purchase, including any 
            applicable taxes and other charges. If the payment method cannot be verified, 
            is invalid or is otherwise not acceptable to us, your order may be suspended or cancelled.</li>
           <li>Subscriptions. CERTAIN OF THE PAID SERVICES PROVIDED BY EscortsAffair MAY BE OFFERED ON A 
            SUBSCRIPTION BASIS WITH AUTO-RENEWING PAYMENTS (“SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES”). THE BILLING PERIOD 
            FOR EACH TYPE OF SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE WILL BE AS SPECIFIED VIA THE EscortsAffair SERVICE AT 
            THE TIME OF REGISTRATION. WHEN YOU REGISTER FOR ANY SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE, YOU EXPRESSLY 
            ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT (I) EscortsAffair (OR ITS DESIGNATED THIRD-PARTY PAYMENT PROCESSOR) 
            IS AUTHORIZED TO CHARGE YOU ON A RECURRING BASIS FOR THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE (IN ADDITION TO 
            ANY APPLICABLE TAXES AND OTHER CHARGES) AT THE THEN-CURRENT RATES FOR AS LONG AS THE 
            SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE CONTINUES, AND (II) THE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE WILL CONTINUE UNTIL YOU 
            CANCEL IT OR WE 
            SUSPEND OR STOP PROVIDING ACCESS TO THE EscortsAffair SERVICE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE TERMS</li>
           <li>Cancellation Policy For Subscription Services. TO CANCEL ANY SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE, YOU MUST 
            CONTACT US THROUGH OUR HELP CENTER VIA OUR MOBILE APP OR WEBSITE AND FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS 
            IN THE EMAIL WE SEND YOU IN RESPONSE TO YOUR CANCELLATION REQUEST. YOU MUST CANCEL A 
            SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE BEFORE THE START OF THE NEXT BILLING PERIOD IN ORDER TO AVOID CHARGES 
            FOR THE NEXT BILLING PERIOD’S FEES. FOLLOWING ANY CANCELLATION, YOU WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE 
            ACCESS TO THE 
            SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES (SUBJECT TO THESE TERMS) THROUGH THE END OF YOUR CURRENT BILLING PERIOD.</li>
           <li>Price Changes. EscortsAffair RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MODIFY THE FEES FOR ANY PAID SERVICES, 
            INCLUDING ANY SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES, FROM TIME TO TIME IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION. 
            FOR SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES, PRICE CHANGES WILL APPLY TO THE NEXT BILLING PERIOD.</li>
           <li>Taxes. You are responsible for any sales, duty or other governmental taxes or 
            fees due with respect to your purchase of Paid Services. We will collect applicable 
            sales tax if we determine that we have a duty to collect sales tax, 
            and will provide notice of such taxes at the time you place your order.</li>
           <li>No Refunds. Except as provided in Section 5(H), or as otherwise expressly agreed upon 
            by EscortsAffair, all sales of Paid Services (including any Subscription Services) are 
            final and there are no refunds. 
            THERE ARE NO REFUNDS OR CREDITS FOR PARTIALLY USED SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES PERIODS.</li>
           <li>Errors. In the event of an error in connection with the pricing or charging of Paid 
            Services, we reserve the right to correct such error and revise your order accordingly 
            (including charging the correct price) or to cancel the purchase and refund any amount 
            charged. Your sole remedy in the event of a billing error is to obtain a refund for the 
            excess amount charged. To be eligible for such refund, you must provide notice of any such 
            error 
            within 120 days of the date of the billing statement in which such error first appeared.</li>
           <li>Delivery. Paid services are delivered instantaneously. Any delay in delivery of services 
            due to outside forces will not hold EscortsAffair responsible. Time of delivery caused by 
            problems beyond the control of EscortsAffair, such as server problems, 
            internet connections, or any kind of unnatural forces will hold EscortsAffair harmless.</li>
