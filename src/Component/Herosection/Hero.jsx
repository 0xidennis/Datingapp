        What we offer
        </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 text-justify">
      It’s a whole new experience with EscortsAffair. There are no complications. 
      It serves well whether you’re lonely 
      or looking for someone to spend quality time with.

       To get the best experience, you need to know about the different code-words. 
       Gfe (Girlfriend experience) is a clear example. “Can I get to know you?” “Let’s get 
        comfortable.” These are terms used to communicate with escorts.

        Fortunately, you can benefit so much from ads posted as photos and videos on our website — 
        numerous to be precise.

        The following benefits come with striking a meeting using our escort directory:

        No hassle
        Yes, you can match mature escorts using our platform. EscortsAffair displays ads 
        in different categories. Just look at it this way: “Mr. X craves to ease his mind from work, 
        so he decided to go online and check websites for ads.”

        You really don’t need to go through any complicated dealings. If the profile you visit is 
        splendid enough that you feel like seeing the person, you can start an honest conversation 
        and discuss your motive immediately.

      <h2 className="text-l font-semibold mb-4">Things to have in mind
       </h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
        There are two things to have in mind when working with girls:

      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 text-justify">
        <li>First, note that clients and escorts spend time together in exchange 
          for payment — not sex or anything — just time only.</li>
        <li>Secondly, you probably are accessing these local ads because you stay within the region. 
          Taking the next step by clicking through all depends on you.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className="text-l font-semibold mb-4">Types of services</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 text-justify">
      Escort services vary, depending on both the customers and personnel in the local ads. Keep in 
      mind that knowing how to make
       your approach profoundly matters. Another thing is the agreed spot to meet.

       Say, you’re conversing with a female from one of the profiles. Your first motive would be getting 
        to 
        know each other, right? Next thing; you’re planning on meeting. This is where the services come in, and they are as follows:
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="text-l font-semibold mb-4">Outcall service</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 text-justify">
      After an escort agent posts an ad, say, you clicked through to communicate with 
      someone that attracts you. You then ask if she would like to come over. If she s
      ays yes, then you are the host, and she’s rendering an out-call service.

      </p>
      
      <h2 className="text-l font-semibold mb-4">Incall service</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 text-justify">
      It’s the other way round here. Your companion may feel the need to stay in his/her location 
      because of some reason. Hence, you have no other option than to do the visiting. It may be a 
      bar, hotel, lounge, or amusement park. If your consort 
      decides the location, and you have to go over to her side, it’s called an incall service.
      </p>
      
      <h2 className="text-l font-semibold mb-4">Specialties</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 text-justify">
        It is essential to know how this works. Who knows what your expectations are?
        Maybe you need a companion just to talk things out and ease the burden in your mind.
        Or perhaps, you’re looking to meet new friends — local ads can help know residents around your region.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 text-justify">
        If at all you want to spend quality time with your company, you need not worry.
        Our website helps in the following areas:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 text-justify">
        <li>Maintaining interpersonal relationships with clients.</li>
        <li>Surfing and acquiring useful information for emergency use.</li>
        <li>Communicating with external individuals, people outside the organization.
            This helps us to keep a stable relationship and learn from clients’ overall experience.</li>
        <li>Reflective communication: we stay in contact with our agents to monitor all happenings.
            This includes communicating through phone calls. Our supervisors also create a
            strong presence by keeping in touch with assigned escorts.</li>
        <li>Developing and retaining useful knowledge: the secret behind our commitment
            is using what works and eliminating what doesn’t. We will continue to maintain
            the same approach towards an appointment.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 className="text-l font-semibold mb-4">What are the traits to find in display ads?</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 text-justify">
      A lot, to be precise. Here at EscortsAffair, you don’t just find random peers to match. 
      Here are the traits to expect:

      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 text-justify">
        <li>Clarity: Be sure to converse clearly with any of our assigned escorts.</li>
        <li>Oral expression: Get a sense of feeling when receiving a response from the peered personnel.</li>
        <li>Oral comprehension: this is one skill every escort must have — the ability to collect and 
          interpret 
          ideas in spoken words.
            This helps us to keep a stable relationship and learn from clients’ overall experience.</li>
        <li>Problem sensitivity: this serves as the ability to identify issues or situations going 
          sideways. 
          Note that it’s not the escorts’ job to solve the problems. They only have to identify them</li>
        <li>Fluency: English serves as the easiest and common way of communicating. All our escorts are 
          great speakers.
        </li>
        <li>Customer experience: have in mind that you’ll be dealing with experienced companions, 
          whose job is to make time worth spending together.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 text-justify">
      This site allows agents to post photos and videos of young and mostly independent
       individuals looking to socialize. No doubt, people need companionship. Some go through 
       depression; others need advice or someone for an event. This platform created spaces for 
       different categories, depending on the type of escort you want.
